 HR_DASHBOARD_PBI
HR Analytics Dashboard | Power BI Project

 📌 About the Project
This is a Power BI dashboard built to analyze HR data from a company dataset. The goal was to identify key insights about employee headcount, attrition rates, average salary, and other workforce trends in a clear and interactive way.

This was done as part of my personal learning to practice Power BI data modeling, DAX, and visualization techniques.
